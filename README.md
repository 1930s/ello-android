# Ello Android
Ello's open source Android app

The app is a very simple wrapper around our React based web application. We handle a few of the rough edge cases but leave nearly all the functionality of the web app intact. Over time we will likely move portions of the experience over to native Android UI.

## Setup

Nothing much to it. Clone and sync gradle and you should be good to go.
